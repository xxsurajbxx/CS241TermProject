blackjack pays 3:2 (good for player)

8 decks

dealer hits on soft 17 (bad for player but very standard)

you are allowed to double after splitting (good for player)

4 hands total

American style peek (dealer checks for blackjack before letting players play)

you are not given the option to surrender (bad for player)

Aces can be split as many times as you want (a bit unconventional but gives player an advantage)
