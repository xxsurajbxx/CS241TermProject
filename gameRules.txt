blackjack pays 3:2 (good for player)

dealer stands on all 17's (good for player)

you are allowed to double after splitting (good for player)

no respliting aces (bad for player)

4 hands total

American style peek (dealer checks for blackjack before letting players play)

you are not given the option to surrender (bad for player)

for now the shoe is kept in a constant spot however this can be changed to have a randomized shoe (more realistic casino conditions)

todo for now:
    fix the split logic (there are a lot of weird rules relating to splitting)
        blackjack payout should be 1
        4 splits are allowed
        aces are allowed to be split once
        forced stand on split aces

    check basic strategy logic
        make sure that it makes sense

    running out of memory when processing very large numbers of hands. figure out how to use batch processing or stream processing to be able to handle the large volumes of data. This is not as necessary as it only happens for simulations of over 1,000,000 hands (which may be overkill)
