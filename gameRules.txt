blackjack pays 3:2 (good for player)

dealer hits on soft 17 (bad for player but very standard)

you are allowed to double after splitting (good for player)

no respliting aces (bad for player)

4 hands total

American style peek (dealer checks for blackjack before letting players play)

you are not given the option to surrender (bad for player)

Aces can be split as many times as you want (a bit unconventional but gives player an advantage)

Basic Strategy is based on wizard of odds 8 deck basic strategy chart

for now the shoe is kept in a constant spot however this can be changed to have a randomized shoe (more realistic casino conditions)

todo for now:
    fix the split logic (there are a lot of weird rules relating to splitting)
        blackjack payout should be 1
        4 splits are allowed
        forced stand on split aces

    check basic strategy logic
        make sure that it makes sense

    running out of memory when processing very large numbers of hands. figure out how to use batch processing or stream processing to be able to handle the large volumes of data. This is not as necessary as it only happens for simulations of over 1,000,000 hands (which may be overkill)
